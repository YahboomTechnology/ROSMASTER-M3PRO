# Introduction
ROSMASTER M3 Pro is a highly integrated embodied intelligent robot platform developed by Yahboom specifically for ROS education, scientific research experiments, and AI application teaching. It utilizes Mecanum wheels and pendulum suspension chassis for omnidirectional movement. Developed based on the ROS2 Humble system, equipped with a 6DOF robotic arm and a binocular structured light depth camera to perform tasks such as visual recognition, 3D grasping, and precise handling. With dual TOF LiDAR, it enables stable and reliable SLAM mapping and autonomous navigation, as well as LiDAR obstacle avoidance and path planning. Unlike traditional ROS robots, the ROSMASTER M3 Pro deeply integrates cutting-edge AI large-scale model technology. Built-in speech recognition and natural language understanding modules, can realize voice command control, multimodal interaction with text/image/voice, task planning and execution, and dynamic environment perception. Whether used in AI courses, robotics algorithm teaching, or university research projects, the ROSMASTER M3 Pro provides a stable, powerful, and easily scalable experimental platform, making it an ideal choice for AI and robotics education.
